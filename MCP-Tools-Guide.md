# MCP Tools Guide for Prompt Engineering Studio

## What are MCP Tools?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools are capabilities that allow AI assistants like me (Claude) to interact with external systems and perform actions beyond just generating text. They enable automation of development tasks.

### 3. Docker Management
- **Would Enable**:
  - Starting/stopping containers
  - Viewing container logs
  - Managing images
  - Modifying docker-compose files and applying changes
- **Current Alternative**: I provide docker commands for you to run

### 4. API Testing
- **Would Enable**:
  - Making HTTP requests directly
  - Testing API endpoints
  - Validating responses
  - Performance testing
- **Current Alternative**: I generate curl commands for testing

### 5. Process Management
- **Would Enable**:
  - Starting development servers
  - Managing background processes
  - Viewing process logs
  - Restarting services
- **Current Alternative**: I provide commands for you to run in terminal

## How to Request Tool Usage

### Examples of Effective Requests:

1. **"Fix the TypeScript error in the broker API"**
   - I'll use Read to analyze the error
   - Use Edit to fix the code
   - Explain what was wrong

2. **"Create a new API endpoint for user management"**
   - I'll use Write to create new files
   - Use Edit to update existing routes
   - Generate tests for the endpoint

3. **"Find all places where Redis is used"**
   - I'll use Grep to search for Redis references
   - Analyze the usage patterns
   - Suggest improvements if needed

4. **"Set up a new package for authentication"**
   - I'll create the package structure
   - Write the package.json
   - Create initial implementation files
   - Update the monorepo configuration

5. **"Debug why the WebSocket connection is failing"**
   - I'll read relevant files
   - Search for error patterns
   - Identify the issue
   - Provide a fix

## Tool Limitations

### What I Cannot Do:

1. **External Services**
   - Cannot create accounts on websites
   - Cannot obtain API keys for you
   - Cannot accept terms of service

2. **System Operations**
   - Cannot install software on your system
   - Cannot modify system configurations
   - Cannot access files outside the project directory

3. **Long-Running Processes**
   - Cannot start and maintain servers
   - Cannot run watch modes
   - Cannot execute interactive commands

4. **Security Restrictions**
   - Cannot access sensitive system files
   - Cannot execute potentially harmful commands
   - Cannot bypass authentication

## Best Practices for Tool Usage

### 1. Be Specific
- Instead of: "Fix the error"
- Say: "Fix the TypeScript error in broker-api/src/app.ts line 113"

### 2. Provide Context
- Instead of: "Create a new feature"
- Say: "Create a user profile feature with GET/PUT endpoints and TypeScript types"

### 3. Ask for Validation
- "Create the feature and then show me how to test it"
- "Fix the error and explain what was wrong"

### 4. Request Documentation
- "Update the README after implementing the feature"
- "Add JSDoc comments to the new functions"

### 5. Think in Steps
- "First, analyze the current authentication system"
- "Then, implement JWT token validation"
- "Finally, create tests for the new functionality"

## Automation Workflows

### Example 1: Complete Feature Implementation
```
1. I analyze requirements
2. Create new files with Write tool
3. Modify existing files with Edit tool
4. Update tests
5. Update documentation
6. Create PR description
```

### Example 2: Debugging Session
```
1. Read error logs
2. Search for error patterns with Grep
3. Analyze problematic code
4. Implement fix
5. Verify fix doesn't break other parts
6. Document the solution
```

### Example 3: Refactoring
```
1. Search for all usages with Grep
2. Plan refactoring approach
3. Update files with MultiEdit
4. Run type checking
5. Update tests
6. Update documentation
```

## Summary

MCP tools allow me to be an active development partner rather than just an advisor. I can:
- ✅ Write and modify code directly
- ✅ Search and analyze your codebase
- ✅ Create comprehensive solutions
- ✅ Fix bugs and errors
- ✅ Generate documentation

But you'll still need to:
- ❌ Run commands in terminal
- ❌ Start/stop services
- ❌ Manage external accounts
- ❌ Execute git operations
- ❌ Run the application

The combination of my tool usage and your command execution creates an efficient development workflow where I handle the complex code work while you manage the runtime environment.
